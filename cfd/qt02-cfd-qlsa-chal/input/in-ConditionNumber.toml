# Condition Number Sensitivity Analysis
# 
# This input file demonstrates how CFD parameters affect matrix conditioning
# and trigger automatic matrix expansion to maintain solvability.
#
# We fix the mesh at 2x2 and vary the pressure gradient to stress the conditioning.
# As the pressure gradient increases, the condition number grows, eventually
# requiring the ORNL code to expand the matrix size (and qubit count) to solve.
