Uses the requirements.txt from ORNL WCISCC2025.
Uses the fvm_euler_1d_solver code based partially on the above.
Makes a dependency set for use in a virtual environment.
Since this uses legacy libs, we will sandbox it in a venv and drive it from elsewhere.
Thus this project exists just for the packaging.
