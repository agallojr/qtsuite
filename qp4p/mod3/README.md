## ▸ Module 3: Overview

Module 3: Modeling Quantum Systems, w. MAT Use Cases

How can quantum programming be used to model quantum systems, and at what scale and fidelity?

Experiment with modeling quantum systems using quantum computing techniques. Map simple atomic systems to physical computing topologies and probe the practical limits of current hardware. With an update on current materials research activities from a subject matter expert, explore interim hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for quantum chemistry applications.

## ▸ Module 3: Topics

+ Q & A

## ▸ Module 3: Homework

t.b.d. after talking to GP in January. Suspect like CFD we'll tailor the homework to fit the current research engagements, that we'll permit working in teams, and we'll have some backup options for different skill levels based on participant experience.
