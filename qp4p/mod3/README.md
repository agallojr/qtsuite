Module 3: Modeling Quantum Systems
How can quantum programming be used to model quantum systems, and at what scale and fidelity?
2 hours lecture & lab in-person / virtual; 1-2 hours post-work

Experiment with modeling quantum systems using quantum computing techniques. Map simple atomic systems to physical computing topologies and probe the practical limits of current hardware. With an update on current materials research activities from a subject matter expert, explore interim hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for quantum chemistry applications. Gain exposure to the roadmaps of leading quantum hardware and software providers and their projections for quantum utility or advantage in specific applications. Be able to communicate the applicability of quantum computing to your domain and identify next steps for further exploration. An in-class lab activity models a simple electron spin chain, with a supported homework to utilize the VQE algorithm for ground state energy estimation.
