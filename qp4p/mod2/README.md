# Quantum Programming for Programmers (QP4P) - Module 2

## Prerequisites

- Attend QP4P Module 1, with its prerequisites and homework.

- Read "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by Mike & Ike, Chapters 5-6, 9.

- Read "Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations", Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd, https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3171

- Read "Variational Quantum Linear Solver", Bravo-Prieto et al, https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05820

- Read "Quantum CFD in 2025: An Industrial Perspective with Use Cases", Gallo & Alhawwary, distributed in this repository.



## Topics


- variational algorithms & optimization
- HHL and VQLS algorithms - HS & 1D nozzle flow

Module 2: Searching and Solving
How can quantum be used for search, optimization, and solving linear systems as in CFD?
2 hours lecture & lab in-person / virtual, 1-2 hours post-work

Gain exposure to key algorithms in quantum computing: for searching unsorted data, prime factorization, optimization, and solving linear systems of equations, and understand their reported advantage relative to classical. Understand the current state of research in applying quantum algorithms to real-world problems in fluid flow with a report-out from a subject matter expert. Run a simple CFD problem in class using the HHL algorithm on a quantum simulator with and without a noise model. Continue your study by exercising the VQLS algorithm for solving the same system in a hybrid quantum-classical setting and attend office hours for support.
